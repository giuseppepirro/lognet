LoGNet: Local and Global Triple Embedding Network

LoGNet(Local and Global Triple Embedding Network) is a learning framework for triple-centric tasks in knowledge graphs (KGs). 
LoGNet is based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and combines local and global triple embedding information. 
Local triple embeddings are learned by treating triples as sequences. 
Global triple embeddings are learned by operating on the feature triple line graph L(G) of a knowledge graph G.
